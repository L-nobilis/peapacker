# peaPacker

## peaPacker is standalone, open-source image channel packer.

Built with C# in Visual Studio, peaPacker serves one purpose: [image channel packing](http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/ChannelPacking).  It requires no installation and will be available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux platforms.  This application was designed to avoid having to fire up bulky image-editing software just to manipulate channels.

PeaPacker utilizes SixLabor's [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) API for pixel processing.

## Releases

peaPacker is still in active alpha development and does not yet have any release builds.  The first build is estimated to be released in early July 2022.   Watch this space!
